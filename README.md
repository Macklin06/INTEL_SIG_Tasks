# WEC Intel SIG Recruitment Tasks â€“ Submission by Macklin Miranda

This repository contains my completed solutions for the **WEC Intel SIG Recruitment Tasks** as part of the recruitment process.  
It includes implementations for the **Mandatory Tasks (1 and 2)**, as well as one **Non-Mandatory Task**.

## Repository Overview

### Mandatory Tasks

#### **Task 1 â€“ Question Answering System**
This task focused on building a **Closed and Extractive Question Answering (QA) model** that provides answers based on a given context.

**Completed Sections:**
- **Part A:** Data loading, preprocessing, and tokenization. Did word embeddings using Word2Vec Skipgram model of gensim library.  
- **Part B:** Built Translation System using pre-trained transformer model (`Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi`).  
- **Finale:** End-to-end QA pipeline using a pre-trained transformer model (`deepset/roberta-base-squad2`).

#### **Task 2 â€“ Machine Learning System Design**
Used pandas, loaded a dataframe using kaggel dataset, wrote a model/function, predicted and visualized the outputs.

---

### Non-Mandatory Task

#### **Semantic Similarity**
Implemented a semantic similarity pipeline that measures similarity between image datasets.
